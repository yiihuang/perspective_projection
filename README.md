# Interactive 3D Perspective Projection Suite

An interactive web application suite that visualizes the principles of **perspective projection** by demonstrating how a 3D cube projects onto different 2D surfaces. This educational tool helps users understand fundamental concepts in computer graphics, computer vision, and technical drawing by comparing **linear perspective** (planar projection) with **hemispherical perspective** (spherical projection).

## üåê **Live Demos**

- **[üöÄ Combined Application](https://yiihuang.github.io/perspective_projection/combined_perspective.html)** - Side-by-side comparison of both projection types
- **[üìê Linear Perspective](https://yiihuang.github.io/perspective_projection/linear_projection.html)** - Traditional planar projection
- **[üåç Hemispherical Perspective](https://yiihuang.github.io/perspective_projection/hemispherical_projection.html)** - Spherical projection with Postel mapping

## üéØ What This Application Suite Demonstrates

This visualization suite shows the mathematical relationships between 3D objects and their 2D projections across different projection surfaces:

### Linear Perspective
- **Planar Projection**: Traditional perspective onto a flat image plane
- **Straight Lines**: 3D edges project as straight lines in 2D
- **Vanishing Points**: Convergence points for parallel lines
- **Fixed Reference Frame**: Viewpoint-centered coordinate system

### Hemispherical Perspective  
- **Spherical Projection**: Projection onto a hemispherical surface
- **Postel Projection**: Mathematical mapping from hemisphere to 2D plane
- **Circular Arcs**: 3D straight lines become circular arcs in 2D
- **Guide Lines**: Visual connections showing arc extensions to vanishing points

### Unified Parameters
- **Radius R**: Controls both hemisphere radius and image plane distance
- **Synchronized Viewpoint**: Same viewpoint position across both perspectives
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Image plane size (2R √ó 2R) matches hemisphere diameter

## üéÆ Interactive Controls

- **Grid**: Reference ground plane

### 2D Projections

#### Linear Perspective
- **Blue Lines**: Projected cube edges (straight lines)
- **Light-colored Guide Lines**: Extensions from vertices to vanishing points
- **Fixed Reference Frame**: Viewpoint always at center, boundary fixed
- **Square Boundary**: 2R √ó 2R image plane boundary

#### Hemispherical Perspective

### Vanishing Points
- **Colored Circles**: Vanishing points for each axis (Red=X, Green=Y, Blue=Z)
- **Multiple Points**: Both positive and negative directions for each axis
- **Transparency**: Different opacity for positive vs negative directions

## üî¨ Mathematical Concepts

### Linear Perspective Projection
For a 3D point `(x, y, z)` and viewpoint `(vx, vy, vz)`, the 2D projection `(x', y')` on an image plane at distance R is:
```
plane_z = vz - R
x' = (x - vx) * (plane_z - vz) / (z - vz) + vx
y' = (y - vy) * (plane_z - vz) / (z - vz) + vy
```
Transformed to fixed reference frame: `(x' - vx, y' - vy)`

### Hemispherical Perspective Projection
1. **Ray-Hemisphere Intersection**: Find intersection of ray from viewpoint through 3D point with hemisphere
2. **Postel Projection**: Map hemisphere point to 2D plane
   ```
   cos(Œ±) = -z / R  (where z ‚â§ 0 for dome extending toward cube)
   arc_length = Œ± * R
   x_2D = arc_length * cos(Œ∏)
   y_2D = arc_length * sin(Œ∏)
   ```

### Circular Arc Generation
For hemispherical perspective, straight lines become circular arcs determined by:
- Two edge endpoints (projected to 2D)
- Corresponding vanishing point (inside boundary circle)
- Circle passing through all three points
